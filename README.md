## Guess the Number Game 🎲

Guess the Number is an interactive web-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on each guess, letting players know if they are "very close," "far away," or need to adjust their guess higher or lower. The closer the player is to the target number, the more specific the feedback, making the game both challenging and engaging.

### 🔍 Key Features

- User Input Validation: Accepts any number input from the user and validates it to ensure it's a number.
- Dynamic Feedback**Provides dynamic hints based on the proximity of the user's guess to the target number:
  - "Very close" if within a range of 5.
  - "Close" if within a range of 10.
  - "A bit far" if within 20.
  - "Far away" if the guess is outside these ranges.
- Random Target Number: Generates a new random number between 1 and 100 for each game session, ensuring a unique experience every time.
- Responsive Design: The game layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
